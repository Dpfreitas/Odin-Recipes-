    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These soft hamburger buns are perfect for burgers, pulled pork, or your favorite sandwich filling. I've gotten a thousand requests for these! Not only are these the perfect shape, but they taste way better than anything that comes out of a plastic bag. The total time takes almost 4 hours, but the actual amount of work involved is maybe 10 minutes.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1(.25 ounce) package active dry yeast (such as Fleischmann's ActiveDry Yeast)</li>
        <li>1 pound all-purpose flour, or as needed - divided</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water (105 degrees F/41 degrees C)</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, divided</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 Â¼ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame seeds, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Place yeast into bowl of a large stand mixer; whisk in 1/2 cup flour and warm water until smooth. Let stand until mixture is foamy, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Whisk 1 egg, melted butter, sugar, and salt thoroughly into the yeast mixture. Add remaining flour (about 3 cups).</li>
            <li>Fit a dough hook onto stand mixer and knead the dough on low speed until soft and sticky, 5 to 6 minutes. Scrape sides if needed. Poke and prod the dough with a silicone spatula; if large amounts of dough stick to the spatula, add a little more flour.</li>
            <li>Transfer dough onto a floured work surface; dough will be sticky and elastic but should not stick to your fingers. Gently form dough into a smooth, round shape, tucking loose ends underneath.</li>
            <li>Wipe out the stand mixer bowl and drizzle in olive oil. Place dough in the bowl and turn it several times until the surface is thinly coated with oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil and let dough rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat or parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Transfer dough to a floured work surface and pat to flatten any bubbles; form into a slightly rounded, 5x10-inch rectangle, about 1/2 inch thick.</li>
            <li>...</li>
        </ol>
    </ul>
